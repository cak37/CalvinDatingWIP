Thank You Stakeholders!

Vision Statement
------------------------
We will be creating a dating app for Calvin students who want to date within Calvin College. Unlike OKCupid or Match.com, our app will tailor the app specifically to what Calvin students care about.

Survey: Tailored to Calvin students' interests
Dates: Suggestions on or around campus.
Local: Restrict search results to Calvin students.
