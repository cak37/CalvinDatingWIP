Vision Statement
------------------------
Our Calvin College dating app helps bring together individuals on Calvin's campus who are looking for a match made in heaven. Unlike OKCupid or Match.com, our app has only Calvin students in mind. This allows for our app to find the best possible match to the profile you have created.

Survey: Tailored to Calvin students' interests
Dates: Suggestions on or around campus.
Local: Restrict search results to Calvin students.
